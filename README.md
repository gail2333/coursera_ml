# coursera_ml
Problem sets and assignments for the coursera machine learning course taught by Stanford Prof. Andrew Ng, completed in **octave/matlab**. Secondly, these problems have been expanded on for my own usage and development purposes in **python using the sckikit-learn library**.

### Unit 4: Project 1-Linear Regression
* Implemented a Linear Regression model to make predictions in several scenarios:
  * with one variable to predict profits for a food truck
  * with multiple variables to predict housing prices in Portland, Oregon.
* Both were implemented in `octave/matlab` for the course work and in `Python using sklearn`
* Files completed:
  * in ex1/
    * `warmUpExercise.m`, `plotData.m`, `gradientDescent.m`, `computeCost.m`
  * ex1_sklearn/
    * `food_truck_profits.py`, `housing_prices.py`

### Unit 6: Project 2-Logistic Regression
1. To model student acceptance rates at a university (linear model/decision boundary)
2. To model whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (non-linear model/decision boundary) (note: Not completed in sklearn, only in octave/matlab.)

* Projects completed in `octave/matlab` for the course work and in `Python using sklearn`
* files completed in ex2/: `plotData.m`, `sigmoid.m`, `costFunction.m`, `predict.m`, `costFunctionReg.m`
* files completed in ex2_sklearn/: `university_admissions.py`
