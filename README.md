# coursera_ml
Problem sets and assignments for the coursera machine learning course by Stanford Prof. Andrew Ng, completed in octave/matlab. Secondly, these problems have been implemented and expanded for my own usage and testing purposes in python using the sckikit-learn library.

### Unit 4: Project 1
* Implemented Linear Regression in several ways:
  1. with one variable to predict profits for a food truck
  2. with multiple variables to predict housing prices in Portland, Oregon.

### Unit 6: Assignment 2
* Implemented Logistic Regression

### Unit 8: Assignment 3
* Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

### Unit 9: Assignment 4
* Neural Networks Learning

### Unit 10: Assignment 5
* Regularized Linear Regression Bias vs. Variance

### Unit 12: Assignment 6
* Support Vector Machines

### Unit 14: Assignment 7
* Image Processing with K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

### Unit 16: Assignment 8
* Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems for Movie recommendations
